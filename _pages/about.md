I am a second-year graduate student in CS at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), advised by [Professor Frederic Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/). I am also happy to be guided by his senior student [Nicholas Roberts](https://nick11roberts.science/). My research interests include Machine Learning with limited data and foundation models. Before that, I earned my B.S. also at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a double major in Computer Science & Mathematics.

  <span>Software Engineer Intern, AI/ML Team</span>
  <span>May 2023 -- Aug. 2023</span>
</p>


- Designed, developed, and deployed a full-stack project with a Slack Bot that integrates Vector Database & Large Language Model which can perform complex Q&A based on custom knowledge by Prompt Engineering.
- Created an efficient data pipeline, ingesting diverse documents (Confluence, Stackoverflow, Github) and generating vector embeddings for rapid retrieval.
- Conducted tests with multiple Large Language Models and different Prompt Design techniques, resulting in a better solution that outperformed the existing Question Answering Slack Bot within the company.

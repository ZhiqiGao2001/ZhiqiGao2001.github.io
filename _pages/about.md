I am a third-year PhD student in CS at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by Professor Frederic Sala. My research focus is on large language models and foundation models; I am particularly interested in i) how to improve their performance via data and ii) how to evaluate them. 

**I am actively seeking a Summer 2026 internship in related fields, please feel free to reach out to me at zhiqi [at] cs [dot] wisc [dot] edu**

- Designed, developed, and deployed a full-stack project with a Slack Bot that integrates Vector Database & Large Language Models (LLMs) which can perform complex Q&A based on custom knowledge by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), resulting in a better solution that outperformed the existing Question Answering Slack Bot within the company.
- Created an efficient data pipeline, ingesting diverse documents (Confluence, Stack Overflow, GitHub) and generating vector embeddings for rapid retrieval.

# Undergraduate Projects

### Tessellations on the Poincaré Half-Plane and Disk 
**Advisor:** [Professor Andrew Zimmer](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~amzimmer2/).  
- Contributed to the "Tessellations on the Poincaré Half-Plane and Disk" project in the Summer 2022 UW-Madison Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) in Analysis funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The culmination of this project is a program that serves an educational purpose, aiding students in comprehending complex concepts through visualization.

### Random Walks on Groups
**Advisor:** [Dr. Nate Fisher](https://sites.google.com/view/natefishermath)  
- Participated in a group project at [Madison Experimental Mathematics Lab](https://mxm.math.wisc.edu/past-semesters/sp22/), which utilized Mathematica to simulate random walks in various groups, including $\mathbb{Z}^n$ and the Heisenberg group, and to analyze their long-term patterns, such as distance traveled, expectation of hitting time, and distribution of hitting location.
